## Introduction

Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, where each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. This project uses ENet, a highly efficient neural network, to classify pixels in images with real-time performance.

## Features

- Lightweight and efficient ENet architecture.
- Pixel-wise classification with a color-coded output mask.
- Overlay of segmentation results on the original image.
- Visual legend displaying class names and corresponding colors.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.6 or later
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- imutils
- Pre-trained ENet model and metadata files:
  - `enet-model.net`
  - `enet-classes.txt`
  - `enet-colors.txt`
